abstract = {Many categorical axioms assert that a particular canonically defined natural transformation between certain functors is invertible. We give two examples of such axioms where the existence of any natural isomorphism between the functors implies the invertibility of the canonical natural transformation. The first example is distributive categories, the second (semi-)additive ones. We show that each follows from a general result about monoidal functors.}

abstract = {Reversible computing models settings in which all processes can be reversed. Applications include low-power computing, quantum computing, and robotics. It is unclear how to represent side-effects in this setting, because conventional methods need not respect reversibility. We model reversible effects by adapting Hughes' arrows to dagger arrows and inverse arrows. This captures several fundamental reversible effects, including serialization and mutable store computations. Whereas arrows are monoids in the category of profunctors, dagger arrows are involutive monoids in the category of profunctors, and inverse arrows satisfy certain additional properties. These semantics inform the design of functional reversible programs supporting side-effects.}

abstract = {Algebraic data types and pattern matching are key features of func- tional programming languages. Exhaustivity checking of pattern matching is a safety belt that defends against unmatched excep- tions at runtime and boosts type safety. However, the presence of language features like inheritance, typecase, traits, GADTs, path- dependent types and union types makes the checking difficult and the algorithm complex. In this paper we propose a generic algorithm that decouples the checking algorithm from specific type theories. The decoupling makes the algorithm simple and enables easy customization for specific type systems.},
