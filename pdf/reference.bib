abstract = {Reversible computing models settings in which all processes can be reversed. Applications include low-power computing, quantum computing, and robotics. It is unclear how to represent side-effects in this setting, because conventional methods need not respect reversibility. We model reversible effects by adapting Hughes' arrows to dagger arrows and inverse arrows. This captures several fundamental reversible effects, including serialization and mutable store computations. Whereas arrows are monoids in the category of profunctors, dagger arrows are involutive monoids in the category of profunctors, and inverse arrows satisfy certain additional properties. These semantics inform the design of functional reversible programs supporting side-effects.}

abstract = {Algebraic data types and pattern matching are key features of func- tional programming languages. Exhaustivity checking of pattern matching is a safety belt that defends against unmatched excep- tions at runtime and boosts type safety. However, the presence of language features like inheritance, typecase, traits, GADTs, path- dependent types and union types makes the checking difficult and the algorithm complex. In this paper we propose a generic algorithm that decouples the checking algorithm from specific type theories. The decoupling makes the algorithm simple and enables easy customization for specific type systems.},

Inverse categories, restriction categories in which each map is a partial isomorphism, provide exactly this structure. This thesis explores inverse categories and relates them to both quantum computing and standard non-reversible computing. The former is achieved by showing that commutative Frobenius algebras form an inverse category. The latter is by establishing the equivalence of the category of discrete inverse categories to the category of discrete Cartesian restriction categories — this is the main result of this thesis. This allows one to transfer the formulation of computability given by Turing categories onto discrete inverse categories.},

	abstract = {Given a category with a stable system of monics, one can form the corresponding category of partial maps. To each map in this category there is, on the domain of the map, an associated idempotent, which measures the degree of partiality. This structure is captured abstractly by the notion of a restriction category, in which every arrow is required to have such an associated idempotent. Categories with a stable system of monics, functors preserving this structure, and natural transformations which are cartesian with respect to the chosen monics, form a 2-category which we call {MCat}. The construction of categories of partial maps provides a 2-functor Par : {MCat} → Cat. We show that Par can be made into an equivalence of 2-categories between {MCat} and a 2-category of restriction categories. The underlying ordinary functor Par0 : {MCat}0 → Cat0 of the above 2-functor Par turns out to be monadic, and, from this, we deduce the completeness and cocompleteness of the 2-categories of M-categories and of restriction categories. We also consider the problem of how to turn a formal system of subobjects into an actual system of subobjects. A formal system of subobjects is given by a functor into the category {sLat} of semilattices. This structure gives rise to a restriction category which, via the above equivalence of 2-categories, gives an M-category. This M-category contains the universal realization of the given formal subobjects as actual subobjects. c 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Restriction categories provide a convenient abstract formulation of partial function. However, restriction categories can have a variety of structures such as finite partial products (cartesiane s), joins, meets, and ranges which are of interest in computability theory, semigroup theory, topology, and algebraic geometry. This thesis studies these structures. For finite partial products (cartesiane ) , a construction to add finite partial product to an arbitrary restriction category freely is provided. For joins, we introduce the notion of join restriction categories, describe a construction for the join completion of a restriction category, and show the completeness of join restriction categories in partial map categories using M-adhesive categories and Mgaps. As the join completion for inverse semigroups is well-known in semigroup theory we how the relationships between the join completion for restriction categories and the join completion for inverse semigroups by providing adjunctions among restriction categories, join restriction categories, inverse categories, and join inverse categories. For meet , we introduce the notion of meet restriction categories, show the completeness of meet restriction categories in partial map categories whose M-maps include the regular monies, and provide a meet completion for restriction categories and discuss its connections with the meet completion for inverse semigroups. Finally, for ranges, Schein's representation theorem for a certain class of semigroups ( called type 3 function system) is generalized to range categories and when a partial map category satisfies Schein's condition ([{RR}.6]) that guarantees each map is an epimorphism onto its range is studied.},
